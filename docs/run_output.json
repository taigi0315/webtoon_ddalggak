  "story_text": "Episode 6: The Afterward\nTitle: The Morning After the Rain\nSunday morning, 9 AM. Ji-hoon hasn't left his apartment. Min-ji hasn't either—he can hear her moving around upstairs. Yesterday's rain confession plays on loop in his mind. \"I love you too. Loved. Love. All the tenses.\" She said it. She actually said it. So why hasn't she texted? Why hasn't he? Because she said tomorrow. She said to ask tomorrow. But it's tomorrow now. So why is he paralyzed on his couch, phone in hand, too scared to type \"good morning\"?\nHis phone buzzes. Tae-young: \"Emergency brunch. Hana says you've been weird. Spill.\" Ji-hoon: \"Can't. Busy.\" Tae-young: \"Doing what? It's Sunday.\" Ji-hoon: \"Things.\" Tae-young: \"You're being weird again. I'm coming over.\" Ji-hoon: \"DON'T.\" Too late. Three dots, then: \"Already in your lobby. Mrs. Park let me in. She says hi and also that you and your 'girlfriend from upstairs' are very cute together.\" Ji-hoon groans and drags himself to the door.\nTae-young enters carrying coffee and pastries, takes one look at Ji-hoon's face, and grins. \"Oh man. You've got it bad.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" \"You have the same face you had senior year every time Min-ji walked into the library. Lovesick puppy face.\" \"I do not have a—\" \"What happened? And don't say nothing. You've been dodging my calls for two weeks.\"\nJi-hoon collapses on the couch. Tae-young hands him coffee and waits. \"Min-ji moved into this building,\" Ji-hoon finally says. \"WHAT. When? Where? How?\" \"Three weeks ago. Fourth floor. Right above me.\" Tae-young's jaw drops. \"You've been living one floor below Min-ji for three weeks and didn't tell me?\" \"It's complicated.\" \"It's always complicated with you two. Keep going.\"\nJi-hoon tells him everything—the moving truck, the elevator encounters, the laundry room confessions, two weeks of coffee dates, yesterday's rain-soaked rooftop disaster. When he finishes, Tae-young is staring at him. \"Let me get this straight. You both confessed you've been in love with each other for seven years. In the rain. On a rooftop. Like a literal K-drama. And now you're sitting here instead of upstairs kissing her because...?\" \"Because she said to ask her today. About us. And I don't know how.\"\n\"Dude.\" \"I know.\" \"DUDE.\" \"I KNOW.\" \"You text her right now. No, wait—you go upstairs and knock on her door and tell her you want to try. You want to be together. You want all of it.\" \"What if she changed her mind?\" \"What if she's sitting upstairs thinking the same thing about you?\" Ji-hoon's phone buzzes. Both of them lunge for it. Min-ji: \"Are you home?\"\nTae-young shoves Ji-hoon toward the door. \"GO. NOW.\" Ji-hoon: \"Give me a second!\" Tae-young: \"NO SECONDS. YOU'VE HAD SEVEN YEARS OF SECONDS. GO!\" Ji-hoon types with shaking hands: \"Yeah, why?\" Min-ji: \"Can I come down?\" His heart stops. Him: \"Yes.\" Her: \"Give me five minutes.\" Tae-young whoops. \"She's coming here! To your apartment! This is happening!\" \"You need to leave.\" \"Are you kidding? I'm not missing this.\" \"TAE-YOUNG.\" \"Fine! But I want details later. All of them.\"\nTae-young leaves, passing Min-ji in the hallway. \"Morning, Min-ji!\" She's wearing pajama pants and Ji-hoon's old college hoodie again, hair in a messy bun, glasses on, no makeup. She looks perfect. \"Morning, Tae-young,\" she says, eyebrows raised. \"Just leaving?\" \"Just leaving. You two crazy kids have fun.\" He winks and disappears into the elevator. Min-ji and Ji-hoon stand in his doorway.\n\"Hi,\" she says. \"Hi,\" he replies. \"Can I come in?\" \"Of course.\" She enters his apartment—her first time inside. Looks around at his tidy space, his bookshelves, the plants on the windowsill, the sketches pinned to a corkboard. Stops at the sketches. Most of them are of her. Different angles, different expressions, different moments from college. She's quiet for a long time.\n\"You drew me,\" she says finally, voice small. \"A lot.\" \"You were my favorite subject.\" She touches one sketch gently—her laughing in the library. \"When did you draw these?\" \"Senior year. After you left, I couldn't stop. It was the only way to... to keep you close.\" She turns to him, eyes shining. \"Ji-hoon.\" \"I know it's weird. I should probably take them down—\" \"Don't. Please don't.\"\nThey stand in his living room, seven years of longing filling the space between them. \"You said to ask you today,\" Ji-hoon says. \"I did.\" \"So I'm asking. Do you want to try this? Us? For real?\" Min-ji walks to his couch, sits down. He sits next to her, careful to leave space. \"I've been up all night thinking about it,\" she says. \"And?\" \"And I'm still scared. Terrified, actually. What if we're better as an idea than as reality? What if seven years of built-up fantasy doesn't match who we actually are now?\"\n\"Then we figure it out. Together.\" \"What if we're incompatible? What if we drive each other crazy?\" \"We probably will. I leave dishes in the sink. You steal blankets. We'll fight about stupid things.\" \"This is not a great sales pitch.\" \"I'm not trying to sell you on perfect. I'm trying to sell you on real. On trying. On giving us an actual chance instead of living with what-if for another seven years.\"\nShe's quiet, thinking. He waits, heart pounding. Finally: \"I have conditions.\" \"Okay.\" \"We take it slow. Real slow. We're basically strangers who happen to have history. We need to actually date. Get to know who we are now, not who we were.\" \"I can do slow.\" \"And we're honest. Brutally honest. If something's not working, we say it. No more running away.\" \"Agreed.\" \"And we don't tell people yet. Not until we're sure. I can't handle the pressure of everyone knowing and watching.\"\n\"Wait, people? Who would—\" \"Mrs. Park already thinks we're dating. Tae-young clearly knows. If we tell my friends and your parents, it becomes this big thing. Can we just... keep it between us for now?\" He wants to argue. Wants to shout from the rooftops that Min-ji is giving them a chance. But he sees the fear in her eyes, the way she's holding herself carefully. \"Okay. Just us. For now.\" \"Thank you.\" \"Is that all?\" \"One more thing.\" \"Anything.\"\n\"I need you to promise that if this doesn't work, we'll still be neighbors. Still be friends. I can't lose you completely again.\" The request breaks his heart. She's already planning their ending. But he understands—she's protecting herself. \"I promise,\" he says. \"If it doesn't work, we'll figure out how to be friends. But Min-ji?\" \"Yeah?\" \"It's going to work.\" \"How do you know?\" \"Because we've already survived the worst. We've already lost each other once. Anything else is bonus.\"\nShe smiles—real, genuine, the smile he fell in love with seven years ago. \"Okay then. Let's try. Slow and careful and honest.\" \"Slow and careful and honest,\" he agrees. They shake hands formally, which makes them both laugh. The tension breaks. \"So what now?\" she asks. \"Now I make you breakfast?\" \"You cook?\" \"I've learned a few things in seven years.\" \"Impressive. What's on the menu?\" \"Pancakes? Your favorite used to be chocolate chip.\" \"Still is,\" she admits.\nThey move to his kitchen. He pulls out ingredients while she sits on his counter, watching. \"This feels surreal,\" she says. \"What does?\" \"Being here. In your apartment. About to eat pancakes. Planning to date you.\" \"Good surreal or bad surreal?\" \"Scary surreal. Like if I blink, it'll disappear.\" \"I'm not going anywhere,\" he promises, mixing batter. \"Neither am I,\" she says softly. \"Not this time.\"\nThey eat pancakes—slightly burnt because he was distracted watching her lick chocolate off her fingers. They talk about small things—her terrible boss, his latest project, the fact that their building's elevator is definitely haunted (Mrs. Park's theory). They don't talk about the big things. Not yet. They're not ready. But it feels like progress. Like maybe, possibly, they're finding their way.\nAt noon, Min-ji stands to leave. \"I should go. Let you have your Sunday.\" \"You can stay.\" \"Slow, remember?\" \"Right. Slow.\" At his door, she pauses. \"Thank you. For breakfast. For being patient.\" \"Thank you for taking a chance on us.\" She reaches out, squeezes his hand briefly, then lets go. \"Same time tomorrow? Coffee?\" \"It's a date,\" he says, then panics. \"I mean—not a date-date. Just coffee. Neighbors who are trying to—\" She kisses his cheek, cutting off his rambling. \"It's a date. See you tomorrow, Ji-hoon.\" And she's gone, leaving him standing in his doorway, touching his cheek, grinning like an idiot again.\nHis phone buzzes immediately. Tae-young: \"Well???\" Ji-hoon: \"We're trying. Slow. Together.\" Tae-young: \"FINALLY. Drinks tonight to celebrate?\" Ji-hoon: \"Can't. Early coffee date tomorrow.\" Tae-young: \"You're disgusting. I'm so happy for you.\" Ji-hoon smiles at his phone. Above him, Min-ji's footsteps. His phone buzzes again. Min-ji: \"Your pancakes were terrible by the way.\" Him: \"You ate three of them.\" Her: \"I was being polite.\" Him: \"You're never polite.\" Her: \"Fair point. They were actually pretty good. Don't tell anyone I admitted that.\" Him: \"Your secret's safe with me.\" Her: \"I have a lot of secrets safe with you.\" Him: \"I'll keep them all.\" Her: \"I know you will. That's why I'm trying.\"",

Do you want to try this? Us? For real?\" Min-ji walks to his couch, sits down. He sits next to her, careful to leave space. \"I've been up all night thinking about it,\" she says. \"And?\" \"And I'm still scared. Terrified, actually.
