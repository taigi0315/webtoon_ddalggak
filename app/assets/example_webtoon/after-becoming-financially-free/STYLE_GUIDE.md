## === WEBTOON VISUAL STYLE GUIDE ===

### CORE AESTHETIC
A polished **Modern Adult Romance** style featuring clean digital cell-shading mixed with soft airbrushed gradients. Characters are rendered with semi-realistic proportions but stylized facial features (large eyes, glossy lips). The visual tone oscillates between bright, saturated intimate moments and cool-toned, atmospheric dramatic scenes.

### SHOT COMPOSITION

**Establishing shots:**
- Modern urban settings (high-end apartments, offices, cars)
- Clear perspective but often simplified backgrounds to keep focus on characters
- Use of depth of field (blurring backgrounds) to simulate camera lens

**Medium shots:**
- Dominant framing for character interactions and dialogue
- Focus on body language and physical proximity/touch
- Clear separation of character from background using rim lighting

**Close-ups:**
- High emphasis on facial expressions (blushing, gaze, sweat drops)
- "Glossy" rendering of eyes and lips for allure
- Used heavily for emotional or intimate beats

**Angles:**
- Dynamic low/high angles used to emphasize power dynamics or allure
- Dutch tilts for tension or disorientation in arguments

### VISUAL BEATS RHYTHM

**Intimate beats:**
- Soft focus, floating light particles/sparkles
- Warm skin tones with emphasized blushing (pink gradients + hatched lines)
- Slower visual pacing with larger panels

**Dramatic/Action beats:**
- Sharper contrast, sweat drops, speed lines for sudden movement
- Cool color grading (night blues, shadows)
- Jagged or bold speech bubble tails

### LINE ART

**Line weight**: Bold and Varied
- Strong, confident black outlines for character distinctness
- Tapered lines for hair strands and inner details (muscles, clothing folds)

**Line quality**: Digital and Clean
- Vector-like smoothness, very little "sketchiness"
- Consistent thickness around the silhouette, finer inside
- Colored lines sometimes used for hair highlights or skin softness

### COLOR PALETTE

**Dominant colors**:
- **Skin Tones**: Highly prioritized. Warm, pinkish-peach tones with soft reddish gradients for elbows, knees, cheeks, and noses.
- **Environment**: Modern neutrals (greys, browns, whites) for interiors, contrasting with the vibrant characters.

**Color temperature**:
- **Intimacy**: Warm (Oranges, Pinks, Soft Yellows)
- **Night/Drama**: Cool (Deep Blues, Purples, Greys)

**Rendering style**:
- **Cell-Shading + Airbrush**: Hard shadow edges for defined forms (muscles, clothes) softened with airbrush gradients for skin roundness.
- **Highlights**: Glossy white highlights on skin (oil/sweat look), hair, and lips.

### LIGHTING & ATMOSPHERE

**Light direction**: Usually cinematic/studio lighting.
- **Rim Lighting**: Frequently used to pop figures from background (white or light blue rim).
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Soft shadowing in crevices to add depth.

**Atmospheric effects**:
- **Steam/Mist**: Used in bath or humid scenes to diffuse details.
- **Bokeh/Particles**: Circles of light used in background for romantic ambiance.
- **Sweat/Tears**: Droplets rendered with reflection/refraction points.

### CHARACTER RENDERING STYLE

**Proportions**:
- **Male**: Broad shoulders, defined musculature (abs, pectorals), sharp jawlines. Idealized "fit" physique.
- **Female**: Hourglass figures, soft curves, delicate features. Idealized beauty standards.

**Facial features**:
- **Eyes**: Sharp, distinct. Men have narrower, intense eyes. Women have larger, lashed eyes.

- **Hair**: Chunky strands with "halo" lighting or sharp zigzag highlights.

**Clothing**:
- Modern fashion (suits, casual wear, lingerie).
- Folds are rendered with distinct hard shadows following the form.

### BACKGROUND TREATMENT

**Detail level**:
- Functional/Contextual. Not overcrowded.
- Modern architecture (clean lines, tiled walls, car interiors).
- Often blurred (Gaussian blur) to simulate depth of field and focus attention on foreground characters.

### VISUAL EFFECTS & TECHNIQUES

- **Sound Effects (SFX)**: Large, colorful Hangul text with thick outlines (Pink, Blue, Yellow).
- **Emotion Indicators**:
    - **Blush**: Red hatched lines + soft pink gradient airbrush.
    - **Sweat**: Teardrop shapes on temples/face.
    - **Shock/Intensity**: Vertical gloomy lines or darkened upper face.

### EMOTIONAL VISUAL LANGUAGE

- **Seduction/Allure**: Glossy highlights, half-lidded eyes, heavy blush, warm hazy lighting.
- **Tension/Anger**: Sharp shadows, constricted pupils, cool blue filter, angular composition.
