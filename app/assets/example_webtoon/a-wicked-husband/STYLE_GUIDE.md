## === WEBTOON VISUAL STYLE GUIDE ===

### CORE AESTHETIC
A high-contrast romantic fantasy style characterized by a dual nature: incredibly soft, ethereal, and sparkling for romantic moments (the "shalala" effect) contrasted with intense, textured, and dark visuals for dramatic or psychological beats. Features jewel-like detailed eyes, idealized semi-realistic anatomy, and heavy use of atmospheric lighting effects (bokeh, glow, emotional flower backdrops).

### SHOT COMPOSITION

**Establishing shots:**
- Uses atmospheric lighting to set emotional tone immediately
- Often frames characters within environmental elements (bed curtains, flowers, shadows)
- Focus on mood rather than purely spatial layout

**Medium shots:**
- Focus on physical proximity and intimacy
- Highlights anatomy (musculature, collarbones, hands)
- Soft focus backgrounds to keep attention on characters

**Close-ups:**
- Extreme focus on eyes and facial micro-expressions
- "Beauty shots" with wind-blown hair and sparkling effects
- Intense framing for psychological horror/drama elements

### VISUAL BEATS RHYTHM

**Detail beats:**
- Extreme detail on irises (galaxy/jewel look) and eyelashes
- Individual hair strands rendered with care
- Textural focus on skin (blush, sweat, soft shading) and fabric folds
- Hand details (fingernails, knuckles) expressing tension or tenderness

**Action/Reaction beats:**
- Romantic reaction: Time seems to stop, floating particles/sparkles, soft gaze
- Dramatic reaction: High contrast, darkened face, intense staring, background dissolves into texture/roses

### LINE ART

**Line weight**: Delicate and Variable
- Very thin, precise lines for facial features (eyes, nose, mouth)
- Slightly stronger contours for jawlines and muscle definition
- Hair strands often have open lines or taper off delicately

**Line quality**: Soft and Blended
- Guidelines often blend into the shading, avoiding a strict "cut-out" look
- Colored line art (brown/red/purple) used instead of pure black for skin and hair to soften the look
- Sketchy or textured lines used extensively in dramatic/horror panels

### COLOR PALETTE

**Dominant colors (Dual Scheme)**:
1.  **Romantic/Intimate**: Pastels, creams, soft whites, light blues, and glowing pinks. Low contrast, high brightness.
2.  **Dramatic/Tense**: Deep crimsons, blacks, dark purples. High contrast, heavy saturation.

**Color temperature**:
- Shifts dramatically based on mood
- Warm, golden/peach tones for intimacy and skin rendering
- Cold, desaturated or harsh red tones for conflict

**Contrast levels**:
- **Soft/Low** for romance (dreamy look)
- **High/Harsh** for drama (graphic impact)

### LIGHTING & ATMOSPHERE

**Light direction**: often diffuse and ambient for romance (glowing from everywhere), sharp and directional for drama.
**Mood effects**:
- **Bokeh/Sparkles**: Heavy use of circular bokeh, floating light particles, and "sparkle" stamps for beauty shots.
- **Glow**: Characters often have a subtle outer glow or rim light (angelic effect).
- **Textured Shadows**: In dramatic scenes, shadows may have hatching or noise textures.

### CHARACTER RENDERING STYLE

**Proportions**:
- Highly idealized, manhwa standard
- Men: Broad shoulders, defined musculature, sharp jawlines
- Women: Delicate features, large expressive eyes, voluminous hair

**Facial features**:
- **Eyes**: The standout feature. Complex rendering with multiple highlight layers, distinct pupil shapes, and rich coloring (e.g., glowing red, distinct green/gold).
- **Lips**: Softly graded color (gradient lip), glossy highlights.
- **Hair**: Flowing, voluminous, rendered with both mass shadows and individual defining strands.

**Anatomy approach**:
- Semi-realistic but heightened ideals
- Focus on aesthetic anatomy (abs, hands, neck lines)

### BACKGROUND TREATMENT

**Detail philosophy**:
- **Selective Detail**: Backgrounds often fade out to focus on characters.
- **Symbolic Backgrounds**: Use of flowers (roses, camellias), geometric patterns, or color washes to represent emotion rather than physical space.
- **Atmospheric**: When environments are shown, they are heavily filtered with light and atmosphere (fog, rays).

### VISUAL EFFECTS & TECHNIQUES

**Emotional effects**:
- **Flowers**: Red roses for danger/passion, white flowers for purity/romance.
- **Symbolic overlays**: Thorns, spiderwebs, or cracking effects for negative emotions.
- **Sparkles/Flares**: Ubiquitous in romantic beats to signify "falling in love" or "beauty".

**Text integration**:
- Sound effects often handwritten or stylized to match the scene mood (shaky for fear, bold for impact).

### EMOTIONAL VISUAL LANGUAGE

- **Love/Awe**: Screen fills with light, soft focus, eyes widen and sparkle, background becomes abstract light.
- **Fear/Obsession**: Background turns black/red, eyes lose highlights or become intense slits, shadows deepen, line art becomes rougher.
