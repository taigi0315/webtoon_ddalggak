  Extract only the IMPORTANT characters from the following story text.
  Include explicitly named characters and implied characters ONLY if they are plot-relevant or recurring.
  Do NOT include incidental background roles (e.g., movers, clerks, passersby) unless they directly affect the plot.

  Rules:
  - Extract up to {{ max_characters }} characters
  - Include evidence quotes showing where each character appears
  - Assign roles: "main" for central characters (max 2), "secondary" for others
  - For implied characters, create a descriptive name (e.g., "Jina's Mother" not just "mom")

  OUTPUT SCHEMA:
  {
    "characters": [
      {
        "name": "Character name",
        "role": "main|secondary",
        "evidence_quotes": ["Quote from text showing this character"],
        "implied": false,
        "relationship_to_main": "relationship if applicable or null"
      }
    ]
  }
