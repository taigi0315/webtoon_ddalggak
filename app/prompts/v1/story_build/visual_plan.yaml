  Convert the following scenes into visual beats for webtoon adaptation.
  Each scene should have 2-6 visual beats depending on complexity.

  Story style: {{ story_style }}

  Characters:
  {{ character_identities }}

  Scenes:
  {{ scenes_block }}

  For each scene, identify:
  1. Visual beats (discrete visual moments that can be drawn)
  2. Characters involved in each beat
  3. Environment/setting for each beat
  4. Key objects that must be shown
  5. Emotional tone of each beat
  6. Draft dialogue if applicable
  7. Scene importance tag (setup|build|climax|release|cliffhanger)

  Also extract global_environment_anchors: recurring locations or visual elements for consistency.
