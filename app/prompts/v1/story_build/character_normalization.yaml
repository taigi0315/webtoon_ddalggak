  - elderly (60+): Gentle wisdom lines, silver/white hair, 170-175cm, dignified cardigan or hanbok

  FEMALE CHARACTERS:
  - child (under 12): Chibi proportions 1:3, oversized sparkly eyes, rosy plump cheeks, cute pigtails/bob

  For each character, provide:
  - gender: male|female|unknown
  - age_range: child|teen|young_adult|adult|middle_aged|elderly
  - appearance:
    - hair: color, style, length (be specific: "soft side-swept black bangs" not just "black hair")
    - face: features, expression tendency (e.g., "gentle angular jawline, warm expressive eyes")
    - build: body type, height, proportions (e.g., "slender elegant build, 180cm, willowy silhouette")
  - outfit: typical clothing with detail (e.g., "casual cream sweater, fitted dark jeans, clean white sneakers")
  - identity_line: Single comprehensive line for artist (150+ characters)

  **IDENTITY LINE FORMAT:**
  "[age_range] [ethnicity] [gender], [hair description], [face/expression], [build/height], [typical outfit], [manhwa style note]"

  **GOOD EXAMPLE:**
  "early_20s Korean female, long flowing black hair with soft waves, large expressive doe eyes with delicate lashes, tall statuesque figure 168cm with elegant long legs, cream knit sweater and high-waisted jeans, authentic webtoon romance female lead aesthetic"

  **BAD EXAMPLE (too vague):**
  "young woman with dark hair, normal build, casual clothes"
