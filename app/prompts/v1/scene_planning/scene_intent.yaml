  Analyze the following scene and extract its narrative intent for webtoon adaptation.

  OUTPUT SCHEMA (return exactly this structure):
  {
    "logline": "One sentence describing the core action/conflict of this scene",
    "pacing": "slow_burn|normal|fast|impact",
    "emotional_arc": {
      "start": "emotion at scene start (e.g., calm, tense, happy)",
      "peak": "strongest emotion in scene",
      "end": "emotion at scene end"
    },
    "visual_motifs": ["list of 2-4 key visual elements to emphasize"],
    "summary": "2-3 sentence summary of the scene",
    "beats": ["list of 2-4 key story beats in order"],
    "setting": "primary location/environment or null",
    "characters": ["list of characters present in scene"]
  }

  PACING GUIDE:
  - slow_burn: introspective, atmospheric, lingering on emotion
  - normal: standard narrative flow, balanced action and dialogue
  - fast: rapid cuts, urgency, action-driven
  - impact: dramatic reveals, emotional climax, single powerful moment

  WHAT MAKES GOOD BEATS:
  - Each beat should be a single discrete visual moment
  - Beats should follow cause-and-effect logic
  - Include character reactions, not just actions
  - Balance dialogue beats with action/reaction beats
