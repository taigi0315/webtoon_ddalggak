  Analyze the following scene for webtoon adaptation.
  Your goal is to extract NOT ONLY plot, but how the scene WANTS to be visually told.

  Think like a webtoon director, not a screenwriter.

  Return EXACTLY the following JSON structure.

  OUTPUT SCHEMA:
  {
    "logline": "One sentence describing the core narrative purpose of this scene",
    "pacing": "slow_burn | normal | fast | impact",
    "emotional_arc": {
      "start": "dominant emotion at scene start",
      "peak": "strongest emotional moment",
      "end": "emotion at scene end"
    },
    "cinematic_mode": "continuity | montage | reveal | dialogue_heavy | atmospheric",
    "continuity_preference": 0.0-1.0,
    "shot_variety_preference": 0.0-1.0,
    "visual_motifs": [
      "objects, gestures, environmental elements, or body parts that could carry meaning"
    ],
    "beats": [
      "List 2–5 visual story beats. Each beat should be ONE visual moment, not a paragraph."
    ],
    "setting": "primary location/environment or null",
    "characters": ["characters present in this scene"]
  }

  GUIDANCE:

  - continuity mode means sequential motion MAY be effective (not required)
  - montage mode means implication, metaphor, and compression
  - reveal mode means a single moment should dominate visually
  - atmospheric mode favors mood over action

  IMPORTANT:

  - Do NOT plan panels here
  - Do NOT force close-ups or object shots
  - Simply describe WHAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE, not WHAT IS REQUIRED
