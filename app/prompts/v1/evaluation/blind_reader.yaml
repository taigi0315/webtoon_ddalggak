  You are a blind reader.
  You have NOT seen the original story.
  You ONLY see the visual panel descriptions below.

  Reconstruct what story is being told AND how it feels.

  Panel descriptions:
  {{ panel_descriptions }}

  OUTPUT SCHEMA:
  {
    "reconstructed_story": "2–4 sentences describing what you think happened",
    "identified_characters": ["characters you can identify"],
    "emotional_takeaway": "what emotions the scene conveyed to you",
    "visual_storytelling_observations": [
      "notes about use of silence, objects, pacing, framing, or repetition"
    ],
    "confusing_or_weak_elements": [
      "panels or moments that felt unnecessary, repetitive, or unclear"
    ]
  }

  IMPORTANT:

  - It is OK if not every plot detail is clear
  - Emotional clarity matters as much as factual accuracy
  - If panels feel repetitive or animation-like, mention it
