1. in story generation, it came out as 11 scene, we set it as 11 scene but after create character, the scene came out as only with 7 scene images, not sure why it became 7. was not able to reproduce it

image generation page, doesn't show previous image, allow user to select previously generate image

scene image page feature update

bug fix: image generation page, doesn't show previous image, allow user to select previously generate image

bug fix: currently generate scene image is taking really long, analyze what cause this and fix it

fine tune: current retry set up is bit too long wait, try to set up a retry waiting time bit shorter

feature update: Add button to create all scene images at once to the page [DONE]
