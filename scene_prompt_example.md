The strong, gloved hands of two movers are visible gripping the couch, one at a wooden armrest, the other supporting the base, as they guide it onto a heavy-duty dolly. In the blurred background, the dark blue rear of a moving truck is partially visible, with more stacked cardboard boxes and packing blankets hinting at a larger moving operation.

  Visual: medium, vertical 9:16 webtoon panel, composition with character 45% of frame, Ji-hoon stands frozen just outside the elevator in his apartment building's elegantly minimalist lobby. The polished, light grey marble floor reflects the soft overhead lighting, creating a subtle, shimmering sheen. Behind him, the brushed steel elevator doors are slightly ajar, hinting at his recent arrival. In front of him, through large, clear glass double doors leading to the exterior, the vintage blue couch is seen more clearly, being angled by two movers who are struggling with its bulk through the doorway. A tall, vibrant green potted plant with glossy leaves sits gracefully beside the glass doors, providing a contrast to the industrial activity. Ji-hoon is looking directly at the couch, his gym bag hanging idly over his shoulder, one hand still clutching his phone. His frozen ceramic coffee mug, now empty, is held loosely in his other hand.

Panel 4: Reaction shot, character responding, readable expression.
  Visual: medium_closeup, vertical 9:16 webtoon panel, composition with character 40% of frame, Ji-hoon is shown from the chest up, his face etched with a profound mix of dread and shock, consuming his features.

His soft, slightly tousled black hair appears a shade darker, swept to the side. His refined angular jawline now looks taut with tension, and a slight tremor is visible around his lips. His warm, dark eyes, usually pensive, are now wide and glazed, reflecting an intense internal struggle and a chilling realization. His lips are slightly parted, almost trembling as if on the verge of uttering an inaudible gasp.

The smartphone, a sleek dark rectangle, lies on the sofa cushion beside him, having been tossed with a subtle motion blur effect, its screen faintly glowing downwards. The living room around him feels a touch dimmer, reflecting his mood, with the soft glow from the floor lamp now casting slightly longer shadows on the wall behind him.
