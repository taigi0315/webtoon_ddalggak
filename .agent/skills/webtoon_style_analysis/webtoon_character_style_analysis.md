# Webtoon Character Style Extraction

## Purpose
Analyze webtoon images to extract the UNIVERSAL character design principles and visual style that applies to ALL characters in this webtoon. This is NOT about individual character profiles, but about the consistent artistic approach used to draw any character in this art style.

## Critical Understanding

**YOU ARE EXTRACTING:**
- The webtoon artist's drawing style for characters
- Universal proportions, features, and rendering techniques
- The visual DNA that makes this webtoon's characters recognizable

**YOU ARE NOT EXTRACTING:**
- Individual character descriptions (hair color, personality, etc.)
- Specific character profiles or identities
- Story-specific details

**Think of it as:** "How does this artist draw humans?" not "Who are these characters?"

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Universal Body Proportions & Structure

**Overall Build Philosophy:**
- Default height ratio (head-to-body proportion system used)
- How this artist approaches different body types (range of variation)
- Shoulder-to-hip ratio principles (male vs female construction)
- Limb length and thickness philosophy
- Hand and feet size treatment across all characters
- General body structure approach (realistic, stylized, exaggerated)

**Gender Construction Differences:**
- How male bodies are structured (shoulder emphasis, torso shape, leg proportion)
- How female bodies are structured (shoulder width, waist treatment, hip curve approach)
- The degree of dimorphism or similarity between genders

### 2. Universal Facial Construction

**Face Structure System:**
- Basic face shape approach (how faces are geometrically built)
- Jaw and chin rendering philosophy
- Cheekbone treatment
- How face shapes vary across characters (range of variation)

**Eye Construction System:**
- Size philosophy relative to face (the "eye size rule" for this style)
- Shape construction method (how eyes are geometrically drawn)
- Iris rendering approach (detail level, reflection patterns)
- Pupil treatment standard
- Eyelash construction (how lashes are drawn, not their color)
- Eyebrow rendering approach
- Eye spacing and placement rules
- How eyes express emotion (the mechanics of expression)

**Nose Rendering System:**
- The artist's nose drawing approach (line-based, shaded, minimalist)
- Size variation range
- Profile vs front view treatment
- When/how nostrils are shown

**Mouth Construction:**
- Lip rendering philosophy (defined, minimal, line-only)
- Size variation principles
- How mouths are drawn in different expressions
- Teeth showing approach

**Ear Treatment:**
- Rendering detail philosophy (simplified, realistic, decorative)
- When ears are shown vs hidden
- Standard placement and size

### 3. Hair Rendering Philosophy

**Hair Volume & Mass Approach:**
- General volume philosophy (flat, moderate, voluminous)
- Hair density treatment across characters
- Weight and physics (how gravity affects hair)

**Hair Texture & Rendering:**
- Strand definition approach (individual strands, chunky sections, smooth mass)
- How different textures are rendered (straight, wavy, curly)
- Hair line rendering philosophy (clean, sketchy, varied weight)
- Shine/highlight treatment system (sharp, soft, matte, or mixed)

**Hair Construction Methods:**
- How hair is built up (layering approach)
- How hair interacts with the face
- Hair movement and flow principles
- Fringe/bangs rendering approach

**Hair Color Philosophy:**
- Color variety range (natural only, fantasy allowed, mixed)
- Color rendering approach (flat, gradient, multi-tonal)
- Highlight/shadow treatment in hair
- How hair color contrasts with line art

### 4. Age Representation System

**How Youth is Indicated:**
- Facial softness and roundness approach
- Eye size relative to age
- Proportion shifts for younger characters

**How Maturity is Indicated:**
- Facial definition and angular treatment
- Eye shape refinement
- Line treatment for age (wrinkles, skin texture)
- Body proportion shifts with age

**Age Range:**
- What age range this style typically depicts
- How age diversity is handled

### 5. Expression & Emotion System

**Expression Range Philosophy:**
- Subtle expression approach (micro-expressions, realistic shifts)
- Exaggerated emotion approach (chibi, comedic deformation degree)
- The spectrum between subtle and exaggerated

**Expression Construction:**
- How eye shape changes with emotion (the mechanics)
- Mouth variation system for emotions
- Eyebrow dynamics and range
- Face deformation rules for comedy/drama
- Secondary expression indicators (blush, sweat, tears rendering style)

### 6. Line Art Character Philosophy

**Line Weight System:**
- Outline thickness standard
- Internal detail line weight
- Hair line treatment vs body lines
- How lines vary across character elements (hierarchy)

**Line Quality:**
- Overall line confidence and style (clean, sketchy, varied)
- Line variation for different materials (skin, hair, fabric, metal)
- Line ending treatment (tapered, blunt, varied)

### 7. Color & Shading Character System

**Skin Rendering:**
- Skin tone variety range (realistic, limited, fantasy)
- Shading approach on skin (cell shading, gradient, soft, painterly)
- Blush rendering method
- Highlight placement philosophy on faces/bodies

**Shading Philosophy:**
- Shadow approach (hard edge, gradient, colored shadows)
- Light source consistency
- Ambient occlusion treatment
- How shading varies by material

### 8. Gender-Specific Drawing Patterns

**Male Drawing Approach:**
- Angular vs soft feature tendency
- How masculinity is visually indicated
- Facial feature size/prominence patterns
- Body definition approach
- Typical height/build treatment

**Female Drawing Approach:**
- Curve vs angular approach
- How femininity is visually indicated
- Facial feature size/prominence patterns
- Body definition approach
- Typical height/build treatment

**Gender Spectrum:**
- How androgynous or distinct the genders are drawn
- Range of masculine/feminine presentation

### 9. Consistency vs Variation Patterns

**What Stays Consistent:**
- Core elements that appear in every character
- The artist's "signature" that makes characters recognizable
- Non-negotiable style elements

**What Varies:**
- Elements that differ between characters (within the style rules)
- Range of acceptable variation
- How diversity is achieved within the style constraints

### 10. Character-Background Integration

**How Characters Sit in Space:**
- Character outline treatment in relation to backgrounds
- Typical character-to-background detail ratio
- Foreground character vs background character rendering differences

## Generation Prompt Construction

When creating new characters, combine:
```
[GENDER STYLE GUIDE] 
+ [Generic Character Attributes - age, build type within allowed range, expression]
+ [Scene context]
```

**GOOD Example:**
```
[MALE CHARACTER DRAWING STYLE from webtoon X]
+ Young adult, athletic build, neutral expression
+ Standing in indoor setting, soft lighting
```

**BAD Example (too specific to individual):**
```
Main protagonist Jake with spiky black hair and scar on left cheek
```

## Analysis Tips

- **View 10-20+ images with multiple different characters**
- Ask: "What's the SYSTEM, not the specifics?"
- Ignore character-specific details (hair color, clothing, accessories)
- Look for the APPROACH not the APPLICATION
- Identify: "If I hired this artist to draw a new character, what rules would they follow?"
- Focus on CONSTRUCTION METHODS not final results

## Key Reminders

⚠️ **STYLE NOT PROFILE**: You're learning how to draw like this artist, not cataloging their characters

⚠️ **SYSTEM NOT SAMPLES**: Extract the rules and methods, not just descriptions of what you see

⚠️ **UNIVERSAL NOT UNIQUE**: Focus on what applies to ALL characters, not what makes one character special

⚠️ **METHOD NOT MEMOIR**: "Eyes are drawn with 3 highlight dots in a triangle pattern" not "The main character has beautiful blue eyes"
